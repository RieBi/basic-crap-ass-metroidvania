# basic-crap-ass-metroidvania

Our basic prototype metroidvania made as a preparation for future big Pirate Software game.

# Game Design Document

*Theme: You are the weapon*

## Game Summary
A 2D metroidvania set in a dark medieval dungeon where the player goes through several areas, with the final one containing holy grail protected by the final boos, Dragon. At end of each area there's a miniboss. Distinct levels of each area contain puzzles and enemies you have to defeat, with the core of gameplay being that you have several different bodies that you can change and they let you solve different puzzles and get to different areas.

## Inspiration
Partly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons
path of the battlerager dwarf barbarian class where the dwarf
Physically throws themselves towards danger.
It is supposed to be one of the bodies player can use.

Partly inspired by League of Legends darking that they are weapons which can inhabit a human to make it their vessel and they ultimately take control of it and use it to their advantage but also providing them with better abilities.

## Player Experience
The player is actually a sword but can change its appearance, abilities, etc. based on the body it currently occupies. To surpass the levels, depending on the level, you use different abilities to kill the enemies and solve puzzles.

One of the main concepts is that player has only melee attack, why enemies often shoot projectiles, so player will need to avoid them and get close to the enemies to kill them. Upon killing enemies player receives life essences which can be spent in a merchant shop near the end of an area.

Some fun/immersive story/dialogues are played throughout the game (the beginning, between areas, end, maybe some texts in the dungeon).

## Platforms
- Web version
- Windows
- Linux
- *Possibly, Mac

## Development Software
- Godot as the main engine
- Aseprite (Libresprite) for making pixel art
- Ableton Live for making music and sounds

## Theme Interpretation
So the player is technically a sword and the game incentivizes it to quickly get into the battle and kill all the enemies in a bout of rage. You kill. You wreak havoc. You destroy.

## Gameplay Experience

### Controls
Player moves with default WASD, attacks with a mouse or keyboard.
Player can dodge using a specified hotkey and there are special abilities unique to the body being taken.

### UI
There's a display of player's health, the current body being taken, cooldowns of abilities (if any), as well as gold (life essence) count.

## Specifics

All the specifics about mechanics in details, code, assets, music, etc. are discusses in a specified roadmap *Mira* board.
Discord is also used in the development process as a communication tool.
